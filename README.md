## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- Desktop-first workflow
- Plain javascript for mobile navigation toggle

### What I learned

This project helped me improve building layouts with CSS grid. Of course, sometimes depending on the situation, flexbox is a better solution, but for the purposes of this project, I used only grid, just for practice. As for JavaScript, the only challenge was to create a mobile navigation toggle, which was, of course, very useful for DOM manipulation practice.

### Continued development

- CSS grid
- Javascript dom manipulation

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvKK2fs6h4I) - Awesome video from Kevin Powell about styiling scrollbars.
- [Resource 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass) - Great course from Jonas Schmedtmann about CSS. It covers both CSS grid and flex in great detail. After watching his CSS grid sections, I started using it.
- [Resource 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJq6R2b0FoE) - Another great video from Brad Chiff that was very helpful for learning CSS grid.
